# GitHub Bracket Samples

These are quantum tutorials via Amazon Braket, for quantum circuits and Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation. Canonical routines are covered, such as Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), plus hybrid quantum algorithms, like Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).

The structure of these samples are as follows:

- [Beginner Quantum](#simple)
- [Advanced circuits and algorithms](#advanced)
- [Hybrid quantum algos](#hybrid)
- [Quantum ML and optimisation via PennyLane](#pennylane)
- [Braket features](#braket)
- [Bracket Hybrid Jobs](#jobs)
- [Pulse Control](#pulse)
- [Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation](#ahs)
- [Qiskit with Braket](#qiskit)
